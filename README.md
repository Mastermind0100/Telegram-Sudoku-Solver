# Telegram Sudoku Solver
This awesome bot recieves a Sudoku as an input image, solves it and send you back the output on Telegram as text...<br> How Cool is that?
<br>

## Setting Up
All you need to do is install the requirements for python and you're good to go!<br>
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using the bot
1. Its pretty simple. Once the bot is initialised, try sending the command '/start' to see to check if it is indeed set up properly.<br><br>
2. Once you're sure that it is set up, send the image of a Sudoku like this one:<br>

<br><br>
3. Now, wait. it's a heavy code relatively. Give it some breathing space. To kill time, count to 5 mississippi.
4. Done? Try sending a text like: "Hey, you quite finished there?"
5. Bingo! The bot replies with the answer in the form of a chat!
6. Like the project? Give the others a look too!
